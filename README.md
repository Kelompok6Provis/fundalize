Users may and should only test this application with mock data provided from my personal API hosting server (**Common API Server** [source code 💡](https://github.com/brownboycodes/common-api-server) ). Account numbers and User details are fictitious, they have been generated randomly out of imagination, any resemblance of mock data with real people or account numbers is matter of sheer coincidence.
